### Hi there 👋

I love experimenting with new javascript libraries, and frameworks. Most recently, I have been working on the video streaming tech like, WebRTC peer to peer, SFU, have developed media servers using mediasoup, and deployed on Google cloud compute. I have knowledge on react, svelte and all the basic frontend tech, including redux, XState, etc. On the backend side, I use Node JS almost on every project, and have used firebase mostly though I have also worked with mongodb, postgresql. Head over to my GitHub page to look at all the projects, I have worked at.


🌱 Recent Love is typescript. Had a lot of reservations about it, just looked like making simple javascript complex unneccessarily. But when I started using it, then I understood the power of typescript. For an example, I was working on this npm package, and was running into quite a lot of type error bugs, but when i switched to typescript, I was able to complete the package, even though i ran into bugs, was able to find and fix it, thanks to typescript. It made the development journey smooth. 

🔭 I’m currently working on [6buns](https://6buns.com), a WebRTC API, it lets you create and maintain webrtc connections, enabling you to add live video/audio to your app.
